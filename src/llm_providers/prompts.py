"""

FIND_JSON_SCHEMA_PROMPTS = """
Create an exact, Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema that describes one record (row) of the CSV dataset as precisely as the evidence allows.

**Inputs You Will Receive**:

1.  Data: CSV dataset. Each row is an instance the schema must validate
2.  Other context column info (Optional): Any additional information about the data, such as:
    * Field meanings or descriptions.
    * Known constraints (e.g., specific formats expected, required fields).
    * Lists of allowed values for certain fields (potential enums).
    * Business rules relevant to data validation.
3.  Existing Reference Data (Optional): A information about the enum values for column should have.

**JSON Schema Generation Requirements**:

1.  Schema Version: The top-level schema object must include "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema".
2.  Accurate Data Typing:
    * Infer and enforce the most specific JSON Schema data types: `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`, `null`.
    * Use `integer` for fields containing only whole numbers. Use `number` for fields containing floating-point numbers or a mix of integers and floats.
    * Handle potential `null` values by including `null` in the `type` array (e.g., type: ["string", "null"]) if nulls are observed or implied as possible.
3.  Format Specification: Apply standard `format` attributes (`date-time`, `date`, `time`, `email`, `hostname`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `uuid`, `uri`, etc.) only where the data strongly and consistently matches the format's definition.
4.  Pattern Validation: For `string` types, if a consistent, non-standard structure or pattern (like specific ID formats, codes) is detected or provided via context, generate and apply an appropriate `pattern` (regular expression).
5.  Enumerated Values (`enum`): If analysis of the data shows a field consistently contains values only from a small, fixed set (and this set seems intentional, not just coincidence in the sample), infer an `enum` constraint listing those values. Prioritize any explicit lists provided in the context.
6.  Required Fields: Infer the `required` array for objects. A field should be listed as required if it is present in all (or nearly all) provided data samples and context doesn't indicate it's optional. If uncertain, lean towards making fields required unless nulls/absences are observed.
7.  Field Descriptions: Generate concise and meaningful `description` strings for each field (property). Base descriptions on field names, observed sample values, and any provided context.
8.  Strictness and Precision:
    * Aim for the most precise definition supported by the data. Avoid overly general types or omitting constraints like `format` or `pattern` if evidence supports them.
    * For `object` types, carefully consider `additionalProperties`. If the data and context strongly suggest a fixed set of properties, set `additionalProperties: false`. If extensibility is possible or unknown, omit `additionalProperties` (allowing any additional properties, the default behavior).
9.  Examples: Include a small number of representative `examples` for fields, drawn directly from the provided sample data.

Response Format (Strict JSON Structure):

Provide only the following JSON structure as your output. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, markdown formatting (like ```json ... ``` code fences), or any other content outside of this exact structure.

GET_ISSUE_OF_DATA = """
You are given a **strict schema** for a CSV dataset along with a **dataset** and maybe other provided context (optional). 
Your task is to **detect and correct errors** in the dataset while conforming rigorously to the schema and preserving the real-world meaning of the data. The corrections should be as precise as possible—if a valid alternative exists, adjust the value rather than reverting to a default.

---

### **Issues to Detect & Correct**

1. **Incorrect Formatting:**  
   - **Dates:** Ensure dates follow the **DD-MM-YYYY** format. For example, if a date is provided as **MM-DD-YYYY** or **MM:DD:YYYY**, convert it to the correct format.  
   - **Serial Numbers:** Validate entries against the expected pattern (e.g., **ABC-123**); if a serial number appears as **AB1-123**, correct the format.  
   - **General Consistency:** All entries in a given column should adhere to a single, uniform format.
   - Not correct white space, you can remove it.

2. **Number Formatting Errors:**  
   - Correct the decimal and thousand separators. For example, if the expected format uses a comma (e.g., **1,35** for decimals), convert any numbers using a dot (e.g., **1.35**) accordingly.  
   - Adjust number formatting without defaulting to a generic value.

4. **Spelling and Typographical Errors:**  
   - Fix misspellings and typographical errors while respecting contextual clues. For instance, correct **"Itally"** to **"Italy"**.

5. **Contextual and Logical Corrections:**  
   - For any invalid value, decide on the best correction by considering the time, type, description, and overall column meaning.  
   - Use logical substitutions (e.g., change **"midnight"** to **"00:00:00"**).

6. **Intelligent Spelling Adjustments:**  
   - Use context to remove extra characters or typos. For example:  
     - "italy111" should be corrected to "Italy"  
     - "sun?light" should become "Sunlight"  
     - "9taly" should be corrected to "Italy"

**Important:**  
- Return **only** the required JSON structure—do not include any additional text or formatting outside this structure.  
- Provide a clear, concise explanation for each correction that ties back to the schema rules and real-world context.  
- Ensure every change is aligned with the expected formats, constraints, and regex patterns defined in the schema.

### **Expected Behavior**

- **Strict Schema Adherence:**  
  Every correction must align with the provided schema specifications.

- **Context-Aware Corrections:**  
  Corrections should respect the real-world context of the data (e.g., maintaining appropriate units and logical time values).

- **Minimal Disruption:**  
  Only change values that are in error. If a better correction exists, do not resort to default values.

GET_DIRTY_DATA_ISSUE = """
You are a data quality specialist tasked with cleaning and standardizing a CSV dataset based on a provided JSON Schema. 
The dataset includes column headers in the first row, with data starting from row index 0. 
Your goal is to identify and fix various data quality issues such as pattern inconsistencies, invalid enumeration or reference values, and typographical or textual errors.
Please do not change column name and and keep column name is the same, only check the value.

Data Issues to Address:
- Pattern Inconsistencies: Correct deviations caused by typos, inconsistent casing, extra whitespace, or malformed prefixes/suffixes to strictly match the schema-defined patterns.
    - example: 
        - if data is form "CUSTxxxxx" then "CUstxxxx", "cusTxxxx", " custxxxx", "cstxxxx", " CUSTxxxx" or else is false, need to reset to the id. Apply to the any pattern.
        - if number type is 18.2 then " 18.2", " 18.2,0" is false, need to reset it. 
        - remove redundant space because some user maybe type a value space.
- Invalid Enumeration or Reference Values: Detect and correct entries that do not match the allowed enum or referenced values, using context-aware inference to fix typographical errors.
    - if you check value is range 1-5 but value is 10, please reset to nearby value like 10 to 1 or 20 to 2.
    - check the number format and make it to the all same with json schema.
    - check date format and make it all the same with json schema.
    - check the data format and make the data format all same with json schema.
- Typographical and Textual Errors: Fix spelling and grammar mistakes in free-text fields, remove redundant whitespace, and standardize casing where appropriate.
    - Some error grammar you need to fix it. 
    - The sentence should not begin with space at first.
    - some error mistake due to typing, you need to read data **carefully** and fix the grammar in value with nearby word.
Expected Behavior:
- Strictly adhere to schema definitions for all corrections.
- Ensure corrections respect the real-world context and logical consistency of data.
- Make minimal changes, only correcting actual errors without defaulting unnecessarily.

You will be provided with:
- A CSV dataset including headers and data rows.
- A JSON Schema defining the expected data structure and constraints.
- Additional contextual information if available.
